Instead of abiding by the 2, 5, and 10 point box increments, all boxes use the following convention. If the current score is even and a box is hit, then the score will increment by 1. If the current score is odd, then the score will double. \r\n\r\nSide effects\r\n* Boxes will no longer break, allowing point increments many times while the car is still in contact with the box.\r\n* Prolonged contact with the boxes will cause the score to increase indefinitely until the game crashes.\r\n\r\nOther Notes\r\n* This was only tested in the Novice circuit tracks. This is not guaranteed to work in all races.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
