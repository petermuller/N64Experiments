N64Experiments
==============

Just a collection of assembly sources for N64 hacks that I didn't feel needed individual repos.

Included files:
* BARscoring.asm
** Introduces the ability to edit the way bonus points are added during Beetle Adventure Racing.
** Only tested on all Novice level courses.
** Side effects:
*** Bonus point boxes, Groovy boxes, and Nitro boxes do not shatter, allowing you to hit them many times at once, or indefinitely.
